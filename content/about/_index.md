I study <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/software/current-students/courses/index.php" target="_blank">Software Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Victoria" target="_blank"> University of Victoria</a> in British Columbia, Canada. I've written software at <a href="https://ftsinc.com/" target="_blank">Forest Technology Systems</a> and <a href="https://aggregateiq.com/" target="_blank" >AggregateIQ </a>. Outside of school/work I've been learning about functional programming with <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/description.html" target="_blank">OCaml</a>. I also enjoy running, reading, squash, cooking, and meditation.
