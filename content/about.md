Hello, I'm James. I am a software engineering student from the University of Victoria located in British Columbia, Canada. The software engineering program is four and half years of aceadmics with 16 months co-op (internships). I've completed 12 months of co-op.  


My first co-op was at a local company called Forest Techonology Systems (FTS). FTS makes products that monitor the environment and transmit data via cellular and satelite networks. At FTS I worked on an android/iOS application that would connect to stations via Bluetooth/WiFi to set up and configure them. I also worked on a linux based camera system in order to retrieve and transmit system health (ie. data usage, memory, ect). 

My second co-op was at another local company named AggregateIQ (AIQ). AIQ is a political consultancy that works with clients across the political spectrum. At AIQ I worked on distributed systems (K8s, docker, AWS), a web based data importer, and learned about growth marketing applied to politics.

My software interests outside of school/work have been learning about functional programming with Ocaml. 

## Interests

Outside of software I enjoy running, reading, squash, cooking, and meditation.
