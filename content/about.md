Hello, I'm James. I am a software engineering student from the University of Victoria located in British Columbia, Canada. The software engineering program is four and half months of aceadmics with 16 months mandatory co-op (internships). I've completed 12 months of co-op.  


My first co-op was at a local company called Forest Techonology Systems (FTS). FTS makes products that monitor the environment and transmit data via cellular and satelite networks. At FTS I worked on an android/iOS application that would connect to stations via Bluetooth/WiFi to set up and configure them. I also worked on a linux based camera system in order to retrieve and transmit system health (ie. data usage, memory, ect).

My second co-op was at another local company named AggregateIQ (AIQ). AIQ is a political consultancy that works with clients across the political spectrum. At AIQ I worked on distributed systems (K8s, docker, AWS), a web based data importer, and learned about growth marketing applied to politics.

My software interests outside of school/work have been learning about functional programming with the OCamel language. 

## Values

Some of my values:

* honest communication
* meaningful work and relationships
* freedom of ideas and debate
* find the best idea and pursuit it to completetion

## Skills

Here is a list of stuff that I've used in work/school/my spare time. I am not an expert in these, but I am comfortable with the core ideas surrounding each and have built software(varying in complexity) with each. 

High-level concepts:

* Software process (requirement specification, design, implementation, testing, deployment, mantience, estimation, workflows, basic network/application security practices)
* Growth marketing (application metrics/analytics, A/B testing, user acquistion, ect)

Languages:

* OCamel
* Golang
* Typescript
* Typescript
* Java
* Python
* Bash
* C

State management: 

* Redux

Clouds:

* AWS (ELB, S3, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, ECR, RDS, VPC's, DNS)
* GCP

Testing:

* Mocha
* Jasmine
* JUNIT

Configuration management: 

* YAML
* JSON
* ENV files

Deployment:

* gitlab CI/CD
* containers
* k8s (KOPS/AWS)
* Travis 

## Interests

Outside of software I enjoy reading about: microeconomics, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, software, game theory, geopolitics.

I also enjoy running long distances, cooking, and meditation.
